**Background**

Will Han: 

This fork is aiming to fix my private network issue. Here is it, my macbook could connect the Internet via my wireless router in most time, BUT the connection is just broken with some unknown reason sometimes, I ran a ping command in terminal to track and get the result, this is crazy situation recently and I didn't find the root cause.

Only a good news is that if that problem occurs, clicking and holding the Airport/WiFi icon in system menu bar could make the Internet connection alive again. This process did show tips "WiFi: Looking for Networks..." and "WiFi: On".

So, here is a solution, ran a program with ping command to check the connectivity, once the connection is broken, scan the WiFi point list again, problem solved.

I just tried to implementation a mac desktop app like PingMenu and found it in github (thanks for kalleboo's great work), so here is the fork, for my network issue.

h1. PingMenu README

Download compiled version: https://github.com/kalleboo/PingMenu/raw/master/PingMenu.app.zip

h2. tl;dr

Adds a status menu to the OS X menu bar showing the current ping time to google.com

h2. Why did you make this

Was sitting on a train tethering, the connection was going in and out, I wanted to see at a glance the status of the connection. I now use this whenever I'm on a flaky connection.

h2. What does it do

It sends a ping to google.com every 5 seconds:
* If the ping failed, changes the menu text color to red
* If the ping is taking more than 100ms longer than the last one, menu text color turns yellow
* When the ping succeeds, change menu color to black and show the ping time.

Also shows some stats if you select the menu.

h2. What does it not do, but I plan to add at some point (especially if you bug me about it)
* Maybe attempt DNS lookups to test the DNS server
